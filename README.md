# markd
 Developed Markd, a full-stack blog-sharing platform enabling users to create, edit, upvote, and manage articles, with secure user authentication and role-based access control.

Designed and implemented RESTful APIs for user and article management using Express.js and MongoDB with Mongoose.

Built responsive UI using React.js and Tailwind CSS, with client-side routing and state management using React Hooks.

Incorporated JWT-based authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, and CORS configurations to ensure secure user interactions.

Implemented pagination, upvoting, and real-time loading skeletons for improved UX.

🧩 Impact & Optimization
Reduced functionality for guest users by restricting article creation/editing and enabling only read-only access, ensuring better content moderation.

Applied lazy loading and modal reuse, which improved page speed and memory efficiency.

Designed with future scalability in mind: modular architecture, route protection, and potential for WebSocket-based real-time interactions.

✅ Key Achievements
Created production-ready deployment plans using Vercel and MongoDB Atlas.

Used Postman for API testing and ESLint for maintaining code quality.

Implemented sample data generation scripts to simulate production use cases for testing.
